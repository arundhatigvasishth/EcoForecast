🌱 EcoForecast

EcoForecast is a financial simulation platform that helps small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) evaluate whether sustainable investments are economically viable before committing capital. Instead of treating sustainability as a moral gamble, EcoForecast treats it like an investment decision, grounded in data and risk modeling.

🔍 The Problem

SMEs often want to transition to greener operations, but:

Carbon audits are expensive 💸

Consultants are often out of reach 🏢

Operational data is scattered across bills, receipts, and invoices 📄

Sustainability often feels like a leap of faith rather than a financially grounded decision

EcoForecast replaces that leap with a model.

🚀 What EcoForecast Does

EcoForecast allows users to:

📊 Input operational data (revenue, fuel, energy, water costs)

⚡ Add proposed sustainability upgrades

🔄 Compare current operations with green transition scenarios

📆 Generate projected 12-month financial performance

🌿 View a combined Financial & Sustainability Score

🤖 Receive AI-generated insights and recommendations

Instead of assuming fixed outcomes, the backend introduces controlled variability into revenue and cost inputs, running multiple forecast simulations to produce realistic profit ranges instead of a single static number.

Result: Risk-adjusted financial clarity.

⚙️ How It Works

Data Input: Users enter financial and operational information including revenue patterns, operating costs, utility consumption, and proposed upgrades.

Scenario Simulation: The backend applies variability to key financial drivers and runs multiple forecast iterations, aggregating results to estimate expected profit ranges and break-even likelihood.

Scoring Engine: EcoForecast computes:

💰 Financial viability score

🌱 Sustainability impact score

📊 Combined transition readiness index

AI Interpretation: Using Gemini, the platform interprets results, explains projections in plain language, and suggests practical transition strategies.
